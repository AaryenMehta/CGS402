recaptcha v2 - different object identification or "selecting boxes having traffic signal"
recaptcha v3 - no user pop up; embedded in the html/css/js; returns a probability; human if p > 0.5

using vision for checkbox; html and css can not be trusted for finding the checkbox as it may contain junk code to throw webscrapers off
recaptcha solver with 82% accuracy is used in case nocaptcha fails
can also be done with audio recaptcha instead of image; but no one uses that and no one knows that it exists :)

drawbacks/future:
if modern versions of recaptcha comes up then need to train better model for that, or can explore the audio route as well
model for 2nd type of v2 recaptcha can be trained; requires loads of data; even google is using the data to make better driverless cars
